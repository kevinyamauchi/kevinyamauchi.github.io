excerpt: 'A continuum mixture model with distinct collagen (COL) and glycosaminoglycan elastic constituents was developed for the solid matrix of immature bovine articular cartilage. A continuous COL fiber volume fraction distribution function and a true COL fiber elastic modulus ([Formula: see text] were used. Quantitative polarized light microscopy (qPLM) methods were developed to account for the relatively high cell density of immature articular cartilage and used with a novel algorithm that constructs a 3D distribution function from 2D qPLM data. For specimens untreated and cultured in vitro, most model parameters were specified from qPLM analysis and biochemical assay results; consequently, [Formula: see text] was predicted using an optimization to measured mechanical properties in uniaxial tension and unconfined compression. Analysis of qPLM data revealed a highly anisotropic fiber distribution, with principal fiber orientation parallel to the surface layer. For untreated samples, predicted [Formula: see text] values were 175 and 422 MPa for superficial (S) and middle (M) zone layers, respectively. TGF-[Formula: see text]1 treatment was predicted to increase and decrease [Formula: see text] values for the S and M layers to 281 and 309 MPa, respectively. IGF-1 treatment was predicted to decrease [Formula: see text] values for the S and M layers to 22 and 26 MPa, respectively. A novel finding was that distinct native depth-dependent fiber modulus properties were modulated to nearly homogeneous values by TGF-[Formula: see text]1 and IGF-1 treatments, with modulated values strongly dependent on treatment.'
