I am an R&D engineer in the Bioengineering platform at the [Chan Zuckerberg Biohub](https://www.czbiohub.org/). At the Biohub, I build hardware and software tools to make novel measurements on biological systems. Currently, I am leading the development of the in situ transcriptomics platform.

Previously, I designed microfluidic tools for single cell analysis as an NSF Graduate Research Fellow and Siebel Scholar in the [Herr Lab](http://herrlab.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. In addition to working on my dissertation, I was a teaching assistant in the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories Single Cell Analysis course and co-organized the Point of Care Diagnistics seminar.

Outside of the lab, you can find me skiing and climbing in the Sierra.
