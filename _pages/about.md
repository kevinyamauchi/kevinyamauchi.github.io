Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher, advised by Dagmar Iber in the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering at the ETH ZÃ¼rich where I study how physics shapes and constrains biological systems. Towards this, I am combining computer vision and physics-based simulation to connect morphology to the mechanical properties of cells and tissues. Additionally, I am a steering council member and core developer of [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari).

Previously, I was an R&D engineer in the Bioengineering platform at the [Chan Zuckerberg Biohub](https://www.czbiohub.org/). At the Biohub, I built hardware and software tools to make novel measurements on biological systems. In particular, I led the development of the in situ transcriptomics platform.


Outside of the lab, you can find me skiing and climbing.
