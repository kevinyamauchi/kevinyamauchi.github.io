Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher, co-advised by Silvia Arber and Flavio Donato at the Biozentrum. I am writing software for real time pose estimation in support of the lab's goal of understanding how mammals learn to locomote and navigate. Additionally, I am a core developer of [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari).

Previously, I was an R&D engineer in the Bioengineering platform at the [Chan Zuckerberg Biohub](https://www.czbiohub.org/). At the Biohub, I built hardware and software tools to make novel measurements on biological systems. In particular, I led the development of the in situ transcriptomics platform.


Outside of the lab, you can find me skiing and climbing.
