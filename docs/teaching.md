## Engineering design
### UC Berkeley BioE192: Capstone design course
I was a graduate student instructor for the Berkeley BioE capstone course. In this capstone course, we taught the students the engineering design process through a semester-long design project in collaboration with a clinician. I mentored the students through their design project and taught a workshop on electronics prototyping with Arduino. For my work as a graduate student instructor, I received the Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor award.

## Bioinstrumentation

### UC San Francisco Biophysics 219: Fab@Lab
I participated in the founding and <u><a href="https://twitter.com/WallaceUcsf/status/1128382299907641345">teaching</a></u> of the Fab@Lab course at the University of California, San Francisco. In the Fab@Lab course, we introduced first year biology, biophysics, and neuroscience students to designing and building bioinstrumentation via an automated luminometer build.

### Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories Single-cell Analysis course
I helped develop the single cell protein analysis module and served as a teaching assistant for the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories Single-cell Analysis course.
